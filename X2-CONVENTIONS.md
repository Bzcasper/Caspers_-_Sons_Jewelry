## Coding Style

### Indentation and Spacing
- **Indentation**: Use 4 spaces for indentation. Avoid using tabs.
- **Line Length**: Limit lines to 80 characters where possible to enhance readability.
- **Blank Lines**:
  - Use single blank lines to separate logical sections within functions.
  - Use two blank lines to separate function and class definitions.

### Naming Conventions
- **Variables and Functions**: Use `snake_case` (e.g., `user_profile`, `calculate_total`).
- **Constants**: Use `UPPER_CASE` (e.g., `MAX_LIMIT`, `API_KEY`).
- **Classes**: Use `PascalCase` (e.g., `UserProfile`, `DataProcessor`).
- **Private Members**: Prefix private methods and variables with an underscore `_` (e.g., `_helper_function`).

### Comments and Documentation
- **Docstrings**: Use docstrings for all functions, classes, and modules to describe their purpose and usage.
- **Inline Comments**: Write sparingly and only to explain complex logic or important decisions.
- **Keep Updated**: Ensure all comments and docstrings are updated alongside code changes to maintain accuracy.

---

## File Organization

### Directory Structure
- **Root Directory**: Contains high-level directories such as `src/`, `tests/`, `docs/`, and `configs/`.
- **Source Code**: Place all source code files within the `src/` directory, organized by feature or module.
- **Tests**: Store all test files within the `tests/` directory, mirroring the structure of the `src/` directory.
- **Documentation**: Use the `docs/` directory to store all project documentation, including markdown files generated during the SPARC Specification step.
- **Configuration Files**: Keep all configuration and environment files within the `configs/` directory.

### File Naming
- Use meaningful and descriptive file names that reflect their content and purpose (e.g., `user_service.py`, `authentication_module.js`).
- Follow consistent naming patterns across the project to enhance navigability.

### Markdown Files
- Organize markdown documentation according to SPARC steps (e.g., `specification.md`, `pseudocode.md`, `architecture.md`, `refinement.md`, `completion.md`).
- Store all diagrams, sketches, and supplementary materials within the `docs/` directory, maintaining a clear and organized structure.

---

## Version Control

### Commit Messages
- **Clarity**: Write clear and concise commit messages that accurately describe the changes.
- **Format**: Use the imperative mood (e.g., "Add user authentication feature" instead of "Added user authentication feature").
- **Structure**:
  - **Title**: A brief summary of the changes (max 50 characters).
  - **Body**: Detailed explanation of the changes, including the reasoning and any relevant information (wrapped at 72 characters).

### Branching Strategy
- **Main Branch**: The `main` branch should always contain production-ready code.
- **Feature Branches**: Create a new branch for each feature or bug fix (e.g., `feature/user-authentication`, `bugfix/login-error`).
- **Naming Convention**: Use descriptive names that indicate the purpose of the branch.

---

## Documentation

### Comprehensive Documentation
- **Specification**: Document all project specifications in `specification.md`, including functional and non-functional requirements, user scenarios, and UI/UX guidelines.
- **Pseudocode**: Outline the high-level pseudocode in `pseudocode.md`, detailing key functions and modules.
- **Architecture**: Define the system architecture in `architecture.md`, including diagrams and technology stack explanations.
- **Refinement**: Document iterative improvements and optimizations in `refinement.md`.
- **Completion**: Finalize deployment plans and user documentation in `completion.md`.

### Use of Tools
- **Research Tools**: Utilize tools like **Perplexity** to gather information and document findings within the appropriate markdown files.
- **AIDER.chat**: Use **AIDER.chat** for integrating different AI models and document the integration process within `completion.md`.

### Consistency
- Maintain a consistent format and structure across all documentation files to ensure ease of understanding and navigation.

---

## Error Handling

### Best Practices
- **Try/Except Blocks**: Use try/except blocks to handle potential errors gracefully.
- **Specific Exceptions**: Raise and catch specific exceptions rather than generic ones to provide clearer error information.
- **Logging**: Implement logging to record errors and important events, aiding in debugging and monitoring.

### Documentation
- Document error handling strategies and exception hierarchies within the `docs/` directory to ensure clarity and maintainability.

---

## Testing

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Write unit tests for all new functions and classes to ensure individual components work as expected.
- **Integration Tests**: Develop integration tests to verify that different modules interact correctly.
- **System Tests**: Conduct system-wide tests to validate the entire applicationâ€™s functionality and performance.

### Code Coverage
- Aim for at least 80% code coverage to ensure a comprehensive testing suite.

### Test Naming
- Use meaningful names for test functions (e.g., `test_user_creation_with_valid_data`, `test_login_with_invalid_credentials`) to clearly indicate their purpose.

### Automated Testing
- Integrate automated testing into the development workflow to run tests consistently and efficiently.

---

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Techniques
- **List Comprehensions**: Prefer list comprehensions over `map()` or `filter()` for better readability and performance where appropriate.
- **Generators**: Use generators for handling large datasets to conserve memory.
- **Efficient Operations**: Use the `in` operator for membership tests on sets and dictionaries for faster lookups.

### Documentation
- Document performance optimization strategies and rationales within the `performance_considerations.md` file.

---

## Security

### Best Practices
- **Sensitive Data**: Never store sensitive information (e.g., API keys, passwords) in the codebase. Use environment variables or secure vaults instead.
- **Input Sanitization**: Sanitize all user inputs to prevent injection attacks and other security vulnerabilities.
- **Access Control**: Implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms to secure access to different parts of the application.

### Compliance
- Ensure that the project complies with relevant security standards and regulations.

### Documentation
- Document security practices and protocols within the `security.md` file.

---

## Dependency Management

### Environment Setup
- **Virtual Environments**: Use virtual environments (e.g., `venv`, `virtualenv`) for each project to isolate dependencies.
- **Requirements File**: Maintain a `requirements.txt` file (or equivalent) that lists all project dependencies with specified version numbers to ensure reproducibility.

### Version Pinning
- Pin exact version numbers for all dependencies to prevent conflicts and ensure consistency across different development environments.

### Updating Dependencies
- Regularly update dependencies and review changelogs to stay informed about important updates and security patches.

---

## Code Reviews

### Review Process
- **Peer Reviews**: All code changes must be reviewed by at least one other team member before merging into the main branch.
- **Addressing Feedback**: Address all comments and suggestions provided during the review process before merging.
- **Pull Requests**: Use pull requests for all changes to the main branch to facilitate discussion and review.

### Quality Assurance
- Ensure that code reviews focus on code quality, adherence to conventions, and overall project standards.

### Documentation
- Document the code review process and guidelines within the `code_reviews.md` file.

---

## Use of Tools and AI Models

### Research Tools
- **Perplexity**: Utilize **Perplexity** for researching various approaches, architectures, and technical papers during the Specification phase. Document all research findings within the respective markdown files.

### AI Models
- **Architecture Phase**:
  - Use a highly capable model (e.g., **o1 Preview**) to define the system architecture and devise solutions.
  - Employ more cost-effective models (e.g., **GPT-4o**, **GPT-4o-Mini**) to implement these designs efficiently.
- **Completion Phase**:
  - Utilize **AIDER.chat** to combine different AI models for rapid creation of complex applications.

### Documentation of AI Usage
- Document the selection and utilization of different AI models within the architecture and completion markdown files to provide clarity on decision-making and implementation processes.

## Commit and Branching Strategy

### Branch Naming
- **Feature Branches**: `feature/<feature-name>` (e.g., `feature/user-authentication`)
- **Bugfix Branches**: `bugfix/<bug-description>` (e.g., `bugfix/login-error`)
- **Hotfix Branches**: `hotfix/<hotfix-description>` (e.g., `hotfix/security-patch`)
- **Documentation Branches**: `docs/<documentation-topic>` (e.g., `docs/api-endpoints`)

### Commit Structure
- **Atomic Commits**: Each commit should represent a single logical change.
- **Descriptive Messages**: Commit messages should clearly describe what was changed and why.

### Merging Strategy
- **Pull Requests**: All changes should be merged via pull requests to facilitate code reviews and discussions.
- **Rebasing**: Use rebasing to maintain a linear project history where appropriate.
- **Conflict Resolution**: Resolve merge conflicts promptly to avoid integration issues.
